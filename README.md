## Architecture

The application uses a hybrid approach:

- **Web Interface** (`app.py`): Browser-based interface with organized sections
- **Shared Skills** (`skills.py`): Common functionality for both interfaces

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Edge: Full support including speech recognition
- Firefox: Limited speech recognition support
- Safari: Basic functionality (no speech recognition)
